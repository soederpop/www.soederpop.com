## Follow these steps

1. Create a new folder, and open that folder in Visual Studio Code

This folder will be empty at first. That is ok, we are going to start adding files to it.

In VSCode, open a new terminal

<Image
  src="/static/images/claudiajs-tutorial/open-new-terminal.png"
  width={1976 / 2}
  height={412 / 2}
/>

2. Create a package.json file

In the terminal you opened up in VSCode, type the following. ( Don't copy and paste, type everything after the dollar sign. )

```shell
$ npm init --yes
```

3. Install Claudia.js

```shell
$ npm install claudia --save-dev
```

Claudia.js is software that runs on your computer only, and is used to publish your app to AWS.

When we install it this way, we're installing it as a development dependency.

This means our app doesn't need it to run, but we need it to develop our app.

Claudia API Builder is software that our app runs. So we install it as a normal dependency.

```shell
$ npm install claudia-api-builder --save
```

You'll notice after doing this, our `package.json` file has the following in it:

```json
{
  "name": "first-claudiajs-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "claudia-api-builder": "^4.1.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "claudia": "^5.14.0"
  }
}
```

4. Create a app.js handler file

Create a new file called `app.js` and paste the following code into it. Don't worry about what it does yet.

```javascript
var ApiBuilder = require('claudia-api-builder'),
  api = new ApiBuilder()

module.exports = api

api.post('/hello', function (event) {
  return new api.ApiResponse(
    `
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>My First Claudia.js Project</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>Hello ${event.post.name}</h1>
        </body>
      </html>
    `,
    {
      'Content-Type': 'text/html',
    }
  )
})

api.get('/', function () {
  return new api.ApiResponse(
    `
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>My First Claudia.js Project</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>Say Hello</h1>
          <form action="/latest/hello" method="POST">
            <label>What is your name?</label>
            <input type="text" name="name" />
            <input type="submit" value="Say Hello" />
          </form>
        </body>
      </html>
    `,
    {
      'Content-Type': 'text/html',
    }
  )
})
```

Save that file. You're done. You now have an application that you can publish, or deploy, to AWS and share with your friends.
